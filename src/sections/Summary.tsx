      About Me
    </h2>
    <p className="mt-4 text-slate-blue dark:text-parchment">
      As a recent graduate from Oregon State University, I'm passionate about
      developing dynamic, responsive, and meaningful web applications. I have
      hands-on experience in mentoring, code review, and full-stack development
      through my role as a Teacher's Assistant. My project work, from creating a
      real-time typing test app to building a full e-commerce platform for
      custom keyboards, showcases my ability to deliver user-focused,
      high-quality software. <br></br>
      In my free time, I enjoy pickleball, golfing, lifting, and running. I am
      also an avid keyboard enthusiast and love 3D printing parts to fix my 3D
      printer. <br></br>
      Above all, I love learning just about anything, as I believe everyone
      should always be curious. There's something truly magical about
      discovering new ideas and watching your understanding of the world grow,
      as it reminds us that no matter our age or experience, we can always
      become better versions of ourselves.
