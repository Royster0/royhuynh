      About Me
    </h2>
    <p className="mt-4 text-slate-blue dark:text-parchment">
      As a computer science student at Oregon State University, I'm passionate
      about developing dynamic and responsive web applications. I have hands-on
      experience in mentoring, code review, and full-stack development through
      my role as a Teacher's Assistant. My project work, from creating a
      real-time typing test app to building a full e-commerce platform for
      custom keyboards, showcases my ability to deliver user-focused,
      high-quality software.
